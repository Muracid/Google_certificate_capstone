# Google_certificate_capstone
Cyclistic data analysis _ part of google certificate capstone project 
#####################################################

The Google certificate ends with a capstone project, and the choice is given to either study of two existing dataset or study one of our own choice. 
I have decided therefore to start with the studying the Cyclistic dataset. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this repository a file containing the code used to perform the analysis is given.
The work has been carried out using R. 

Note that the work shown is primarly present for the code used rather than carried out in R itself. 
The reason for this is because of the size of the data (the excel files) and the hardware capability to stock and work on the data in memory.
